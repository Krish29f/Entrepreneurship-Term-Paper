\section*{Abstract}
\newcommand\shortlorem{Blockchain  is  the  technology  that  can  lead  to  significant  changes  in  our business environment and will have great impact on the next few decades. It can change the way we perceive business processes, and can transform our economy. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that aims to ensure transparency, data security and integrity, since it cannot be tampered or forged. Most of the current research related to Blockchain Technology is focusing on its application for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and only a limited number of research is targeted at exploring the utilization of Blockchain Technology in other  environments  or  sectors.  Blockchain  Technology  is  more  than  just cryptocurrency, and it can have several applications in government, finance and banking industry, accounting and Business Process Management. Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate and explore its opportunities and challenges for the current or future applications of Blockchain Technology.}

\section*{Introduction}
Blockchain technology  is a revolutionary  computer protocol used for digital recording and storing information on multiple computers or multiple nodes. One of the most important elements of Blockchain is the so-called “Ledger”, which is similar to  a relational database Walport . A Blockchain is a  list of encrypted  digital record  or  transaction, called  a  block.  Each  block is  then “chained”  to  the  next  block,  in  a  linear,  chronological  order,  using  a cryptographic signature . The blocks contain a copy of the last transactions since the last block was added. Thus, the shared block, or ledger, is linked to all participants who use their computers in a network to validate or confirm transactions, removing the need for a third-party. Blockchain is used to secure and distribute data in a new and unique way. The elimination of a central instance in the distributed network implies a radical shift to  direct  transactions  between  non-intermediaries or  intermediary  services.  Thus,  Blockchain  can  only  be  updated  by consensus between participants in the system and a transaction can never be altered or deleted. Its distributed database cannot be  hacked,  manipulated  or  disrupted  in  the  same  way  as  a  traditional, centralized database with a user-controlled access system.   In  other words,  the  data is  immutable  and once  it  has been  written to  a Blockchain, nobody, not even a system administrator, can modify or delete it from  the ledger.  Since,  each data  block  is time  stamped  and linked  in  a chronological order via a cryptographic signature Walport. Blockchain Technology can be applied almost in any type of transaction, involving value, such as money, goods, land ownership, medical records or even votes.  Blockchain does not require data migration in a project; all relevant transaction data will be stored on the ledger and status will be then derived from it. Since, Blockchain is a distributed system without a central control point or authority and it is not regulated by a  single control  center as there might  be with a system administration, there's no single point of failure. Hence, in an enterprise, theoretically, there would be no need for an IT professional to monitor security on a blockchain database.  Despite these possibilities, it’s important to emphasize that Blockchain is a very new technology. As a result, there are only a small number of instances in which the technology has been applied. A proven example, could be the Bitcoins which is the most successful implementation of the Blockchain Technology, and has confirmed to be a viable solution in creating trust in a trust-less ecosystem without central authority.  
The objective of here is to present a review of the Blockchain Technology
and its current or future practical applications. 

\section*{The Concept of Blockchain Technology}
Blockchain Technology is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains
a cryptographic hash code of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction
data (Bogart & Rice 2015), which as designed so that these transactions are
immutable.

The Blockchain concept was devised by Nakamoto (2008) and is displayed in
Figure 2. Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a distributed
ledger recording technology (Walport 2016), which contains information about
transactions or events. It can record transactions in a transparent, secure, decentralized, efficient, and low-cost way.

\textbf Figure 2: The Concept of Blockchain Technology.

Hence, the Blockchain Technology has the following characteristics: a
distributed ledger, decentralized data management, data security, transparency
and integrity, anti-tampering and anti-forgery, high efficiency, low cost,
programmable features that increase flexibility and reliability and no risk of a
centralized database failure.

There are several types of Blockchains, some of the most important are: Public
Blockchain, Private Blockchain and Consortium Blockchain (hybrid
Blockchain). Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, allowing them
to meet the needs of various applications (He et al., 2016; Buterin (2015).
Figure 3 illustrates the Types of Blockchain Technology.
Specifically, using a) Public Blockchain, anyone can transact on the network
transactions which are transparent and are anonymous. A Public Blockchain,
such as bitcoin, is completely decentralized. The system operates based on
users’ consensus; there is no central point of failure. However, Public
Blockchain is vulnerable to system attacks. For instance, an attacker could
recreate and properly chain all the blocks that had been modified, without being
detected by the participants; b) Private Blockchain, the transactions are secret,
the data is not available for public view, but the members are known. In a private Blockchain network, a participant cannot read or write the Blockchain unless the participant has a permission or an invitation to join the network. Private
Blockchain is usually used by large companies with permissions defined
between various stakeholders of the enterprise Blockchain. For instance, a
bank can have its own Blockchain network for its private use with restricted
5
access to its various stakeholders such as customers, employees and
suppliers; c) Consortium Blockchain is a hybrid model of both Public and Private
Blockchain. Choosing this model, enterprises or institutions can have their own
Private Blockchain network to share the data among the consortium
participants (such as banks, institutions and other enterprises or firms).
